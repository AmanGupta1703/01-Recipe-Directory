      "title": "Crispy Air Fryer Tofu",
      "method": " Making flavorful, crisp tofu in the air fryer is possible with a few thoughtful tricks. The key to a crisp exterior is pressing the tofu to get rid of extra water and coating the tofu in a cornstarch mixture after marinating. The cornstarch absorbs into the marinade around the tofu, creating a coating that turns golden brown and crisp in the air fryer. \n\nTofu is mild in flavor, so it’s first marinated in a combination of flavorful ingredients like soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, and sesame oil. The strong combination of flavors in the marinade helps to deeply flavor the tofu so that it’s delicious on its own as well as in salads, noodle dishes, or whatever else you please. \n\nAn added bonus: air fryer tofu is ready from start to finish in under an hour and reheats marvelously.
